1. Activate the robot's TCP/IP connection. (You can skip this step because it is supposed to activate automatically every time the robot starts. But if the robot's history is cleared or an error happens, you need to check and activate it). To do it:
	a. Go to Manual mode(If you are in the Remote control mode, you need to go to Local control mode firstly.) Password for accessing manual mode: ****** Ask from people :)
	b. Go to setting > System > Network, what should be shown on this page is Static address, and the configuration of the Network detailed settings is IP address: 192.168.75.128, Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
		Default gateway: 0.0.0.0  P-DNS: 0.0.0.0 A-DNS:0.0.0.0
	c. If you can not see the above information on this page, set it as above and click apply, then you should see Network is connected.

2. Configurate your Linux laptop(The language on my laptop is Chinese, so the translation may be a little different with your end)
	a. Go to ethernet connecting > settings > IPV4
	b. IPV4 method: Manual, it should be in DHCP firstly if you have never used it before, DON'T CHOOSE THAT.
	c. Input:  IP: 192.168.75.150   Subnet: 255.255.255.0   Gate:0.0.0.0  DNS:0.0.0.0
	d. Click Apply, then you should see information showing that the connecting is successful.

3. Install the API and run your code.

If you have any question about connecting, without any hesitate to let me know.
